% Use of \usepackage[hang]{footmisc} in your preamble is recommended so
% that \papernote looks good.

% You should also add hyperfootnotes=false to the document class options
% since \papernote breaks hyperlinks to footnotes.

% Each chapter should start with these commands in order:

% \paperinfo - "A paper to be submitted to ..."
\newcommand{\paperinfo}[1]{\vspace{-.4 in} \begin{center} #1 \end{center} \vspace{.4in}}
% \paperauthor - exactly what it sounds like
\newcommand{\paperauthor}[1]{\vspace{-.5 in} \begin{center} #1 \end{center} \vspace{.25in}}

% \papernote - may be repeated. This would be role of authors (if multiple),
%              a citation, copyright info, etc. Looks like an unnumbered footnote.
% http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/30720/footnote-without-a-marker

% The following two approaches both more or less work and both break hyperfootnote.
%\newcommand{\papernote}[1]{%
%  \begingroup
%  \renewcommand\thefootnote{}\footnote{#1}%
%  \addtocounter{footnote}{-1}%
%  \addtocounter{Hfootnote}{-1}%
%  \endgroup
%}
\def\papernote{\gdef\@thefnmark{}\@footnotetext}


% TODO make this an option
% Don't include chapter number in section numbering
% \renewcommand\thesection{\arabic{section}}
