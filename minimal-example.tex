\chapter{Intro}


A wide variety of software frameworks for building virtual reality
applications have been developed. The CAVE~Library initially developed
for use with the CAVE~Automated~Virtual~Environment \cite{Cruz-Neira1993}
is an example of early work in the systems category of virtual reality
frameworks. It has evolved into a commercial solution integrating
clustering support and focusing on multi-screen application development.
VR~Juggler introduced a highly modular architecture for VR applications
to provide a ``virtual platform'' for development and execution
on diverse systems \cite{Bierbaum2001,Bierbaum2005}.

A VR~JuggLua application uses both the osgLua module
and the VR~Juggler bindings included in the VR~JuggLua framework
to access a complete set of virtual reality functionality from Lua
(Figure \ref{fig:System-diagram}).
