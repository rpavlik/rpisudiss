  abstract = {Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic
	impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited
	revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations
	of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the
	interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many
	small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at
	MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced
	that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to
	dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent
	programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic
	programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures
	in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical
	programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs
	have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres
	to the IEEE standard.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a system architecture for creating interactive,
	multisensory, three-dimensional environments called virtual worlds.
	The architecture specifically addresses the requirements of virtual
	worlds for high performance, flexibility, and coordination of concurrent
	events. Performance is enhanced by a distributed client/server system
	structure and by efficient overlap of processing time and input/output
	delay. All processes communicate via asynchronous messages. The functional
	partitioning of a virtual world requires relatively low bandwidth
	among the individual processes and the system can be implemented
	over a conventional local-area network. A key element of this architecture
	is a central, event-driven dialogue manager which coordinates concurrent
	input and output events. The dialogue manager provides a clear separation
	of the interaction techniques from the content of the virtual world
	as defined by the application. The system is flexible and easily
	reconfigurable. An interaction technique can be readily changed or
	replaced because each interaction device is modularized into a separate
	server and each interaction modality into a separate subdialogue.
	Subdialogues can be loaded and dropped dynamically, enabling input/output
	device remapping and the selection of interaction techniques while
	a virtual world is running. As an initial test of this architecture
	we have implemented a virtual world for interacting with data from
	a computational fluid dynamics simulation.},

	for the display of immersive virtual environments. We discuss each
	of the potential ways to synchronize a cluster for immersive visualization
	in use today. Then, we describe the VR Juggler cluster infrastructure
	in detail, and we show how it allows virtual reality application
	developers to combine various existing clustering techniques to meet
	the needs of their specific applications.},

	in a desktop environment without constant use of limited VR resources.
	Rather than shifting constantly between VR and workstation environments,
	developers at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) wanted
	to be able to test VR applications on the normal workstation console.
	We therefore created a software simulator for VR development. It
	simulates various VR system features with an interface that runs
	on an ordinary workstation. The simulator is implemented as part
	of the CAVE library, the programming library originally written to
	support the CAVE hardware. It can, however, be used to develop applications
	for several VR systems, including ImmersaDesks and head-coupled displays.
	The library itself has been designed so that use of the simulator
	or any supported hardware is entirely transparent to application
	code},

  abstract = {Haptic force-feedback offers a valuable cue in exploration and manipulation
	of virtual environments. However, grounding of many commercial kinesthetic
	haptic devices limits the workspace accessible using a purely position-control
	scheme. The bubble technique has been recently presented as a method
	for expanding the user’s haptic workspace. The bubble technique is
	a hybrid position-rate control system in which a volume, or "bubble,"
	is defined entirely within the physical workspace of the haptic device.
	When the device’s end effector is within this bubble, interaction
	is through position control. When exiting this volume, an elastic
	restoring force is rendered, and a rate is applied that moves the
	virtual accessible workspace. Existing work on the bubble technique
	focuses on point-based touching tasks. When the bubble technique
	is applied to simulations where the user is grasping virtual objects
	with part-part collision detection, unforeseen interaction problems
	surface. This paper discusses three details of the user experience
	of coupled-object manipulation with the bubble technique. A few preliminary
	methods of addressing these interaction challenges are introduced.},

  abstract = {Ground-based haptic devices provide the capability of adding force
	feedback to virtual environments; however, the physical workspace
	of such devices is very limited due to the fixed base. By mounting
	a haptic device on a mobile robot, rather than a fixed stand, the
	reachable volume can be extended to function in full-scale virtual
	environments. This work presents the hardware, software, and integration
	developed to use such a mobile base with a Haption Virtuose™ 6D35-45.
	A mobile robot with a Mecanum-style omni-directional drive base and
	an Arduino-compatible microcontroller development board communicates
	with software on a host computer to provide a VRPN-based control
	and data acquisition interface. The position of the mobile robot
	in the physical space is tracked using an optical tracking system.
	The SPARTA virtual assembly software was extended to 1) apply transformations
	to the haptic device data based on the tracked base position, and
	2) capture the error between the haptic device's end effector and
	the center of its workspace and command the robot over VRPN to minimize
	this error. The completed system allows use of the haptic device
	in a wide area projection screen or head-mounted display virtual
	environment, providing smooth free-space motion and stiff display
	of forces to the user throughout the entire space. The availability
	of haptics in large immersive environments can contribute to future
	advances in virtual assembly planning, factory simulation, and other
	operations where haptics is an essential part of the simulation experience.},

	existing VR-architectures generally produce application updates at
	a lower rate. Consequently, the display is not updated by the application
	every display frame. This causes a number of undesirable perceptual
	artifacts. We describe an architecture that provides a programmable
	display layer (PDL) in order to generate updated display frames.
	This replaces the default display behavior of repeating application
	frames until an update is available. We will show three benefits
	of the architecture typical to VR. First, smooth motion is provided
	by generating intermediate display frames by per-pixel depth-image
	warping using 3D motion fields. Smooth motion eliminates various
	perceptual artifacts due to judder. Second, we implement fine-grained
	latency reduction at the display frame level using a synchronized
	prediction of simulation objects and the viewpoint. This improves
	the average quality and consistency of latency reduction. Third,
	a crosstalk reduction algorithm for consecutive display frames is
	implemented, which improves the quality of stereoscopic images. To
	evaluate the architecture, we compare image quality and latency to
	that of a classic level-of-detail approach.},

	think. The structure of Lisp makes it easy to extend the language
	or even to implement entirely new dialects without starting from
	scratch. Overall, the evolution of Lisp has been guided more by institutional
	rivalry, one-upsmanship, and the glee born of technical cleverness
	that is characteristic of the hacker culture than by sober assessments
	of technical requirements. Nevertheless this process has eventually
	produced both an industrial-strength programming language, messy
	but powerful, and a technically pure dialect, small but powerful,
	that is suitable for use by programming-language theoreticians.We
	pick up where McCarthy's paper in the first HOPL conference left
	off. We trace the development chronologically from the era of the
	PDP-6, through the heyday of Interlisp and MacLisp, past the ascension
	and decline of special purpose Lisp machines, to the present era
	of standardization activities. We then examine the technical evolution
	of a few representative language features, including both some notable
	successes and some notable failures, that illuminate design issues
	that distinguish Lisp from other programming languages. We also discuss
	the use of Lisp as a laboratory for designing other programming languages.
	We conclude with some reflections on the forces that have driven
	the evolution of Lisp.},

	is done by the compiler). It also means you don't (usually) have
