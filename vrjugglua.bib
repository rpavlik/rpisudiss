  abstract = {Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic
	impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited
	revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations
	of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the
	interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many
	small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at
	MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced
	that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to
	dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent
	programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic
	programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures
	in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical
	programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs
	have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres
	to the IEEE standard.},

  month = jan,
  abstract = {This paper presents a system architecture for creating interactive,
	multisensory, three-dimensional environments called virtual worlds.
	The architecture specifically addresses the requirements of virtual
	worlds for high performance, flexibility, and coordination of concurrent
	events. Performance is enhanced by a distributed client/server system
	structure and by efficient overlap of processing time and input/output
	delay. All processes communicate via asynchronous messages. The functional
	partitioning of a virtual world requires relatively low bandwidth
	among the individual processes and the system can be implemented
	over a conventional local-area network. A key element of this architecture
	is a central, event-driven dialogue manager which coordinates concurrent
	input and output events. The dialogue manager provides a clear separation
	of the interaction techniques from the content of the virtual world
	as defined by the application. The system is flexible and easily
	reconfigurable. An interaction technique can be readily changed or
	replaced because each interaction device is modularized into a separate
	server and each interaction modality into a separate subdialogue.
	Subdialogues can be loaded and dropped dynamically, enabling input/output
	device remapping and the selection of interaction techniques while
	a virtual world is running. As an initial test of this architecture
	we have implemented a virtual world for interacting with data from
	a computational fluid dynamics simulation.},

	for the display of immersive virtual environments. We discuss each
	of the potential ways to synchronize a cluster for immersive visualization
	in use today. Then, we describe the VR Juggler cluster infrastructure
	in detail, and we show how it allows virtual reality application
	developers to combine various existing clustering techniques to meet
	the needs of their specific applications.},

	Rather than shifting constantly between VR and workstation environments,
	developers at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) wanted
	to be able to test VR applications on the normal workstation console.
	We therefore created a software simulator for VR development. It
	simulates various VR system features with an interface that runs
	on an ordinary workstation. The simulator is implemented as part
	of the CAVE library, the programming library originally written to
	support the CAVE hardware. It can, however, be used to develop applications
	for several VR systems, including ImmersaDesks and head-coupled displays.
	The library itself has been designed so that use of the simulator
	or any supported hardware is entirely transparent to application
	code},

  abstract = {Distributed scene graphs are important in virtual reality, both in
	collaborative virtual environments and in cluster rendering. Modern
	scalable visualization systems have high local throughput, but collaborative
	virtual environments (VEs) over a wide-area network (WAN) share data
	at much lower rates. This complicates the use of one scene graph
	across the whole application. Myriad is an extension of the Syzygy
	VRtoolkit in which individual scene graphs form a peer-to-peer network.
	Myriad connections filter scene graph updates and create flexible
	relationships between nodes of the scene graph. Myriad’s sharing
	is fine-grained: the properties of individual scene graph nodes to
	share are dynamically specified (in C++ or Python). Myriad permits
	transient inconsistency, relaxing resource requirements in collaborative
	VEs. A test application, WorldWideCrowd, demonstrates collaborative
	prototyping of a 300-avatar crowd animation viewed on two PC-cluster
	displays and edited on low-powered laptops, desktops, and over a
	WAN. We have further used our framework to facilitate collaborative
	educational experiences and as a vehicle for undergraduates to experiment
	with shared virtual worlds.},

  abstract = {Display systems typically operate at a minimum rate of 60 Hz. However,
	existing VR-architectures generally produce application updates at
	a lower rate. Consequently, the display is not updated by the application
	every display frame. This causes a number of undesirable perceptual
	artifacts. We describe an architecture that provides a programmable
	display layer (PDL) in order to generate updated display frames.
	This replaces the default display behavior of repeating application
	frames until an update is available. We will show three benefits
	of the architecture typical to VR. First, smooth motion is provided
	by generating intermediate display frames by per-pixel depth-image
	warping using 3D motion fields. Smooth motion eliminates various
	perceptual artifacts due to judder. Second, we implement fine-grained
	latency reduction at the display frame level using a synchronized
	prediction of simulation objects and the viewpoint. This improves
	the average quality and consistency of latency reduction. Third,
	a crosstalk reduction algorithm for consecutive display frames is
	implemented, which improves the quality of stereoscopic images. To
	evaluate the architecture, we compare image quality and latency to
	that of a classic level-of-detail approach.},

	produced both an industrial-strength programming language, messy

	that is suitable for use by programming-language theoreticians.We
	pick up where McCarthy's paper in the first HOPL conference left

	PDP-6, through the heyday of Interlisp and MacLisp, past the ascension
	and decline of special purpose Lisp machines, to the present era
	of standardization activities. We then examine the technical evolution
	of a few representative language features, including both some notable
	successes and some notable failures, that illuminate design issues
	that distinguish Lisp from other programming languages. We also discuss
	the use of Lisp as a laboratory for designing other programming languages.

  title = {{Luabind}},
  abstract = {Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ and
	Lua. It has the ability to expose functions and classes, written
	in C++, to Lua. It will also supply the functionality to define classes
	in lua and let them derive from other lua classes or C++ classes.
	Lua classes can override virtual functions from their C++ baseclasses.
	It is written towards Lua 5.x, and does not work with Lua 4. It is
	implemented utilizing template meta programming. That means that
	you don't need an extra preprocess pass to compile your project (it
	is done by the compiler). It also means you don't (usually) have
	to know the exact signature of each function you register, since
	the library will generate code depending on the compile-time type
	of the function (which includes the signature). The main drawback
	of this approach is that the compilation time will increase for the
	file that does the registration, it is therefore recommended that
	you register everything in the same cpp-file.},

  abstract = {Bamboo is a portable system supporting real-time, networked, virtual
	environments. Unlike previous efforts, this design focuses on the
	ability of the system to dynamically configure itself without explicit
	user interaction, allowing applications to take on new functionality
	after execution. In particular, this framework facilitates the discovery
	of virtual environments on the network at runtime. Fundamentally,
	Bamboo offers a compatible set of mechanisms needed for a wide variety
	of real-time, networked applications. Also included is a particular
	combination of these mechanisms supporting a dynamically extensible
	runtime environment. This paper serves as a general introduction
	to Bamboo. It describes the system's architecture, implementation
	and future directions. It also shows how the system can facilitate
	the rapid development of robust applications by promoting code reuse
	via community-wide exchange.},
